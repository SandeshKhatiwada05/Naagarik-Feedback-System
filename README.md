# Naagarik Feedback System

The **Naagarik Feedback System** is a citizen-centric web application developed using ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework. It provides a digital platform where citizens can submit feedback about their localities, allowing government authorities to gather community insights, understand issues, and make informed decisions.
